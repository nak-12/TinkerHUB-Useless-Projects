Project Description
it is a simple math game that jolts users with a surprise when the user is wrong!

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There is a shortage of cringe quiz games that also traumatize the young and old alike!
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Fearcount keeps it simple by introducing a mix of surprise and goosebumps by jolting users with a jumpstart whenever they get their answers wrong or fail to complete in time!
